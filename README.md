# Minishell

## Test

For test:
- enter `src/`
- `make`
- `./minishell`

## TODO

1. merge cgerner(manual?)
2. need to fix: `$?`; single quote vs double quote; quote content as argument, like `echo "    a     b    "`
3. reorganize structure: *.h->`includes/`, Makefile, add `make test` rule
4. (Write a bash script for test?)
